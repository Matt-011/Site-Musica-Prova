            <h3>[Chorus: John Mayer]</h3>
            <p>
                Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me
                I don't want you, but I need you
                I love you and hate you at the very same time
                Bittersweet
            </p>

            <h3>[Refrain: Kanye West]</h3>
            <p>
                See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
                ''Never did this before'', that's what the virgin says
                We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
                God, talk to me now, this is an emergency
            </p>

            <h3>[Verse 1: Kanye West]</h3>
            <p>
                And she claims she only with me for the currency
                You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
                And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
                I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
                We breaking up again, we making up again
                But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
                Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
                And you mix them emotions with tequila
                And you mix that with a little bad advice
                On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
                And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
                And she say, "Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch"
                You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
                I'd never hit a girl, but I'd shake the shit out of you
                But I'ma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
                Oh, I guess I figure it's
            </p>

            <h3>[Chorus: John Mayer]</h3>
            <p>
                Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me
                I don't want you, but I need you
                I love you and hate you at the very same time
                Bittersweet
            </p>

            <h3>[Refrain: Kanye West]</h3>
            <p>
                See, what I want so much should never hurt this bad
                ''Never did this before'', that's what the virgin says

            <h3>[Verse 2: Kanye West & John Mayer]</h3>
            <p>
                And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
                I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
                But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
                And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
                Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me (Be the death of me)
                And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
                But I can't even vibe with you sexually
                'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
                Saying, "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
                You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
                You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
                And I never let a nigga get that close to me
                And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
                You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be"
                And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
            </p>

            <h3>[Chorus: John Mayer, Keyshia Cole & Kanye West]</h3>
            <p>
                Bittersweet (I fucked up and I know it, G)
                You're gonna be the death of me (I guess it's bittersweet poetry)
                I don't want you, but I need you
                I love you and hate you at the very same time
                Bittersweet (Bittersweet, oh)
                You're gonna be the death of me (Oh, oh)
                I don't want you, but I need you
                I love you and hate you at the very same time (I love you and hate you at the very same time)
